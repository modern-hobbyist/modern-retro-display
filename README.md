A DIY Take on the Retro-Style Tidbyt Display

# Intro
First off, I want to say that I think the Tidbyt displays are awesome, and this project is my attempt at making one of my own. However, I do want to mention that this version of the project is far simpler and therefore, can't do nearly as much as the Tidbyt displays. The limitations mainly come from the Raspberry Pi Pico W which only has ~2mb of space available, which gets cut down to about 500kb once you install CircuitPython on it. This pretty much means you only have room for code files, small binary images, and a few choice libraries. This made it tricky to get everything working, and I had to skip out on Python's fancy YouTube API library in favor of some good old fashioned hand-written code. 

Also, unlike the Tidbyt displays, you can't push new apps to this version and there isn't an existing library of apps for you to choose from. No, this project is DIY through and through, so if you want to, say, install a weather app, you better get coding!

In the end, this project turned out awesome, and I was able to display a little logo for my channel, add some scrolling text, and display my subscriber count, in human-format which ended up looking great!
